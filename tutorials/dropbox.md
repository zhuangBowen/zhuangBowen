This tutorial describes how to host a copy of MDwiki with [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com)

Attention: **Free accounts made later than August 2011 will not work with this method.** Try [GitHub Pages](tutorials/github.md) or [Google Drive](tutorials/drive.md) hosting instead. Pro and Business Dropbox accounts can enable their public folder [here](https://www.dropbox.com/enable_public_folder), and still use this tutorial.

### Step 1: Get a Dropbox account

### Step 2: Download `mdwiki.html` to your Dropbox

  * Rename to index.html if you like.

### Step 3: Edit your Markdown files

  * Create an index.md file and edit it. Do not edit the index.html file! Try following the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md).

### Step 4: Public hosting

  * For old, pro, and business Dropbox accounts, you have `Public` folder you can get a link to - this can be used for hosting. If you need a Public folder, get one [here](https://www.dropbox.com/enable_public_folder).
